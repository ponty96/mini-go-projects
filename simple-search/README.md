**A simple full text searh engine**

This is a simple full text search engine that can be used to search for events in a json file.

The goal of a full-text search engine is to optimize lookups of items by string tokens, often at the expense of pre-processing the data and using lots of memory (i.e. the same data stored in multiple different ways).
